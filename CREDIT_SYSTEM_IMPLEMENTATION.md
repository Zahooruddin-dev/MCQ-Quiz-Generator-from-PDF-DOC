# Credit System Implementation - Complete with Refunds

## ✅ What Has Been Implemented

### 1. **Credit Integration in File Upload (ModernFileUpload.jsx)**
- Added credit check before AI quiz generation
- Users with 0 credits are blocked from generating quizzes
- Credit deduction happens before API call to prevent wastage
- Clear error messages for insufficient credits
- Success message shows credit usage

### 2. **Credit Validation in LLMService (llmService.js)**
- Added `checkUserCredits()` method as additional safety check
- Validates user authentication and credit balance
- Handles Premium and Admin users (unlimited credits)
- Throws appropriate errors for insufficient credits

### 3. **Enhanced UI Feedback (ConfigPanel.jsx)**
- Real-time credit display in AI configuration panel
- Visual indicators for Premium/Admin unlimited access
- Credit counter shows "X Credits - 1 per quiz"
- Switch is disabled when no credits available
- Clear messaging about credit requirements

### 4. **Text Input Credit Integration (TextModeInput.jsx)**
- Credit checking for text-based quiz generation
- Button disabled when no credits available
- Clear messaging in button text
- Same credit deduction flow as file upload

### 5. **Credit Refund System (NEW)**
- **Smart Refund Logic**: Credits are automatically refunded when API calls fail
- **Error Detection**: Detects API failures (503, 500, 502, 504, overloaded, service unavailable)
- **Failsafe Design**: Only refunds if credit was actually deducted
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear messaging about refunds in error messages
- **Console Logging**: Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring

### 6. **Firestore Rules Review**
- Existing rules already support credit operations
- Users can read/write their own documents (includes credits)
- Admin has full access for credit management

## 🔧 How It Works

### Credit Flow:
1. **User Login**: Credits loaded from Firestore user document
2. **Daily Reset**: Non-premium users get 5 credits daily (24hr reset)
3. **Credit Check**: Before AI generation, system checks available credits
4. **Credit Deduction**: `useCredit()` function deducts 1 credit and updates Firestore
5. **API Call**: AI service processes the request
6. **Success**: Quiz generated, credit stays deducted
7. **Failure**: `refundCredit()` automatically restores the credit
8. **UI Updates**: Real-time credit counter updates across all components

### User Types:
- **Free Users**: 5 credits daily, reset every 24 hours
- **Premium Users**: Unlimited credits
- **Admin Users**: Unlimited credits (3000 displayed, but unlimited)

### Security Layers:
- **UI Level**: Buttons disabled, clear messaging
- **Component Level**: Credit checking in upload components
- **Service Level**: Additional validation in LLMService
- **Database Level**: Firestore rules ensure users can only modify their own credits
- **Refund Safety**: Credits only refunded if actually deducted, prevents abuse

## 🧪 Testing the Credit System

### Test Scenarios:

1. **Normal Credit Usage**
   - User has credits (1-5)
   - Generate quiz → credit deducted
   - UI shows updated credit count

2. **Zero Credits**
   - User has 0 credits
   - AI toggle disabled with error message
   - Generate buttons show "No Credits Available"
   - Clear error messages displayed

3. **Premium Users**
   - Shows "Premium - Unlimited" chip
   - All AI features available
   - No credit deduction

4. **Admin Users**
   - Shows "Admin - Unlimited" chip
   - All AI features available
   - No credit deduction

5. **Daily Reset**
   - Wait 24 hours or manually reset `lastReset` in Firestore
   - Credits should reset to 5 for non-premium users

6. **API Failure Handling**
   - Temporarily disable API or cause 503 errors
   - Generate quiz → API fails → credit automatically refunded
   - User sees clear message about refund

### Manual Testing Steps:

1. **Test with Credits:**
   ```
   - Login as regular user
   - Check credit display in AI settings
   - Upload file or paste text
   - Enable AI generation
   - Generate quiz
   - Verify credit count decreases by 1
   ```

2. **Test with Zero Credits:**
   ```
   - Set user credits to 0 in Firestore manually
   - Refresh page
   - Try to enable AI generation (should be disabled)
   - Try to generate quiz (should show error)
   ```

3. **Test Premium Flow:**
   ```
   - Set `isPremium: true` in user document
   - Verify "Premium - Unlimited" display
   - Generate multiple quizzes
   - Verify no credit deduction
   ```

4. **Test Refund System:**
   ```
   - User with 3 credits
   - Simulate API failure (disconnect internet or invalid API key)
   - Try to generate quiz
   - Verify credit deducted initially, then refunded
   - Check console for refund messages
   - Verify user sees refund message in error
   ```

### Database Structure:
```javascript
// User document in Firestore
{
  credits: 5,           // Number of credits remaining
  lastReset: timestamp, // Last daily reset time
  isPremium: false,     // Premium status
  // ... other user data
}
```
